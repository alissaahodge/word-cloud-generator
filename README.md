# Word Cloud Generator

## About This Project
This is a random, fun project. The goal of the project is to create a word cloud. A word cloud is an image that's made up of different sized words. Usually the sizes of the words are determined by how many times each word appears in a specific text. For the input, you're going to upload a text file. You can choose any text file you like for your input. It could be the contents of a website, a full novel or even everything that one author has ever written. You just need to make sure that it's one text file, so that it can be processed by the code. :)
